## Description

For the exhibition "Kosmos Kaffee" at Deutsches Museum, Munich, this mobile application was developed to explore the didactic potential of Augmented Reality. The AR app refers to the biological component of coffee cultivation. Users regulate the water balance and the sun in order to best fulfill the needs of the plant. 

This app was developed by Fluxguide as part of the project museum4punkt0 - Digital Strategies for the Museum of the Future, sub-project Rethinking Visitor Journeys. Further information: www.museum4punkt0.de/en/.
